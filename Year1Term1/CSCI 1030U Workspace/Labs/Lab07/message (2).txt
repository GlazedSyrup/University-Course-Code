You can find more information about how Python does I/O in this documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html

CSV:
This stands for comma separated values. A common method for storing tabulated data.
CSV files can be found using the '.csv' file extension.

open(filename, mode):
This function will open a file.
The first argument is a string which is the path to the file (filename).
The second argument is the mode, which determines the permissions the file is opened with. The modes are listed here:
	- 'r'  => Read only 
	- 'w'  => Write only 
	- 'a'  => Append 
	- 'r+' => Read and write
There are other optional arguments, but will not be useful for our purposes. You are free to look into them at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open

with:
This is a keyword that is very helpful for File I/O.
It creates a context for you to interact with the file and closes it after the context finishes.
If you do not use a with statement you will need to have exception handling (try-finally blocks).

File Objects:
file.read(size):
Will return size amount of characters. If not specified returns the entire file.

file.readline():
Reads a single line from the file. Returns an empty string if at EOF.
You can also loop over the file object to read lines.
If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use list(file) or file.readlines().

file.write(string):
Write the content of string to the file.

There are other methods of the File object, such as tell(), seek() but they arent needed for this lab.

You can find more information about JSON here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html

JSON:
JavaScript Object Notation. 
It is a collection of key/value pairs.
In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.

json.dump(path, file):
Write JSON data to specified file.

json.dumps(path):
Write JSON data to a formatted string variable.

json.load(path, file):
Load JSON data from specified file.

json.loads(file):
Load JSON data into a string.
